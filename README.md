### Leading AI medical tools to create a better future for the world
"In the medical field currently without this portable device that the ***Butterfly Network*** has created, many patients would not be having safe births in 3rd world countries (i.e. Africa, Middle Eastern countries, etc.) or access to adequate timing to critical care. 

>This device/company was crafted/incorporated by Jonathan Rothberg in 2011  and cleared by the USA FDA in 2020 . Mr. Rothberg has spent his life crafting medical advances through DNA sequencing (His career started in 1991 and has crafted multiple companies with large advances in medicine.  Matthew Herper, et.al) and had attended a talk by MIT physicist Max Tegmark who enticed him with AI technology. After this talk Mr. Rothberg included a top student from Mr. Tegmarkâ€™s class named Nevada Sanchez  who helped craft the company.
>Together they created the first device (Butterfly iQ) out of a silicon chip like piezoelectric crystals used in traditional ultrasound machines.

The Butterfly iQ is a handheld device that connects to cellphones (Android or Apple) and gives instant results from ultrasounds in emergency situations (for example, in an ambulance, anywhere in the world, bedsides in a hospital, etc.). With the development of this new technology, it saves hospitals and insurance companies thousands of dollars. The initial price was only $2000 per unit. While the company has now evolved to newer versions with more functionality, including being able to be used in a veterinary setting, and other specific parts of the body.  The Butterfly Network currently has 13 different investors. These include the following institutions/ companies;
- Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ($5m) (Current lead investors)
- Tenet Healthcare Corporation $175M
- UPMC Enterprise $175M
- Fidelity $175 M
- Eldridge Industries $175 M
- Ridgeback Capital $175M
- Wellington Management $175 M
- Glenview Capital Management $175 M
- Fosun Pharma $250M.

	Currently the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are the Butterfly Network's lead investors ($5m USD) to aide in the research, development, and distribution into Africa (South Africa and more specifically small villages in desperate need of medical assistance.).As a result of this, this company is leading the advancement in medical care around the world with its unique patents. The device can give accurate results in seconds as opposed to traditional machines which can take hours depending on technicians ability to decipher the images.

   There are currently 4 other companies that have similar technology to the Butterfly Network, those companies are Profound Medical, SuperSonic Imagine, FUJIFILM Sonosite and Analogic. ***None of which come remotly close to the technological advances that the Butterfly Network has crafted.*** Those companies all require large machines and humans to deceipher diagnostic imaging which can be costly and ineffective for serious medical treatments.
  My only suggestion to the company is to team up with hematology physicians/scientist/researchers.I believe their product can make monumental changes in how patients are treated in the critical care gentic conditions disorders. I hope to one day work and help develop a new way to ensure that through the device they created that it would be plausible to view how to prevent blood clots or other veinous issues.
